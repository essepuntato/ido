The development of IDO is one of the outcomes of the agreement between the [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en) and [Imperial](http://www.imperialfashion.com/en/). Part of this agreement is dedicated to the use of Semantic Web technologies for the description and analysis of selling data of Imperial, and, more generally, of fashion design industries.

Currently, IDO allows one to describe the following scenarios in OWL.


### Scenario 1

The company online selling system allows people subscribed to the Imperial online platform to order a stock keeping unit available in the online catalogue in order to receive it at a specified address (currently characterised by a province and its related region). Each ordered stock keeping unit is identified (in some way) by (1) a unique code, (2) the genre (male or female) for whom the item was created, (3) its size, and (4) its colour. Each user of the Imperial online platform has assigned a genre (male or female), a born date, and the province and region of her home.


### Scenario 2

The catalogue of the company includes a detailed description of all the styles (identified by a code) available for selling and/or sold in the past to a certain client. Each style is then associated to a particular category, such as "sweater", "trousers", "jacket", etc. These categories are fixed at a certain time but can be modified (adding more ones or reorganising their hierarchical structure) in the future.


### Scenario 3

A style defines the design of an article of a certain category (e.g., shirt, dress, trousers) and it was designed for one or more genre ("male", "female", or both). An item is a particular realisation of a style according to a certain textile, and proposed for a particular season.

Each item can be made available in different sizes and colours. Any combination of these characteristics defines a stock keeping unit. The piece that is effectively produced, finally, is an exemplar of a stock keeping unit.


### Scenario 4

On the 15th of December 2015, a particular stock keeping unit of a certain item, proposed for the season Autumn-Winter 2015, has COGS set to 15 euros, sell-in set to 24 euros, and sell-out set to 39 euros - all prices are net and include VAT. By the end of the year, 5 pieces of this stock keeping unit were sold: two of them were acquired by a customer (with sell-out price), and three of them were sold to a retailer (with sell-in price). After the sales, which began on the 7th of January 2016, the sell-out price was discounted for the 10% of the amount (35,10 euros). Seven pieces of the same stock keeping unit were then bought by another customer (with discounted sell-out price). On the 15th of January, so as to satisfies the selling requirements during the sales, several pieces of the same stock keeping unit have been produced with a lower cogs (12 euros). 20 of those pieces were sold to a reseller with a lower sell-in price (19,20 euros).


### Scenario 5

On the 15th of January 2016, an order was prepared on the B2B distribution platform (sales channel: e-commerce), which includes 4 pieces (35 euros each) of a stock keeping unit, and other 3 pieces (57 euros each) of another stock keeping unit, for a total value of 311 euros. The invoice associated to that order has been created two days after (same distribution platform and sales channel); it describes the delivery of three pieces of the first stock keeping unit, and of 3 other pieces of the second stock keeping unit (same prices as described in the order). The missing piece of the first stock keeping unit has been substituted with another piece of the same item but with different colour, and has been sold at 37 euros. The total value of the invoice is 313 euros.</span><p class="image"><object data="ido.png" type="image/png"></object></p><div id="annotationproperties"><h2>Annotation Properties</h2><ul class="hlist"><li><a href="#d4e61" title="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy"><span>is defined by</span></a></li></ul><div id="d4e61" class="entity"><a name="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy"></a><h3>is defined by<sup title="annotation property" class="type-ap">ap</sup><span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a> or <a href="#annotationproperties">Annotation Property ToC</a></span></h3><p><strong>IRI:</strong> http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy</p></div></div><div id="namespacedeclarations"><h2>Namespace Declarations <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2><dl><dt><em>default namespace</em></dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido#</dd><dt>dc</dt><dd>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</dd><dt>ido</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido/</dd><dt>items</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido/items/</dd><dt>orders</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido/orders/</dd><dt>owl</dt><dd>http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#</dd><dt>prices</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido/prices/</dd><dt>rdf</dt><dd>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</dd><dt>rdfs</dt><dd>http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</dd><dt>users</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/ido/users/</dd><dt>w3id-org</dt><dd>https://w3id.org/</dd><dt>xsd</dt><dd>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</dd></dl></div><p class="endnote">This HTML document was obtained by processing the OWL ontology source code through <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode">LODE</a>, <em>Live OWL Documentation Environment</em>, developed by <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it">Silvio Peroni</a>.</p></body></html>
